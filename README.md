#Ruby Quick Hands On in 30 mins 
Credit to Codeacademy.com
In Essense, this is what I noted after finishing the 13 hours codeacademy Ruby introductory course. 

This guide is for intermediate programmers who had previous programming experience in Object-Oriented programming who want a taste of Ruby, yet do not have 13 hours to spare on Codeacademy.Don't get me wrong. Codeacademy is a great place to learn new language, I used it all the time, however we often find wasting too much time on entry level stuff such as boolean values.  This will let you take a shortcut and go straight away into understanding Ruby syntax.

My apologizes if some of the codes are unclear to you as this mainly serves as a personal note. Feel free to add on so that it can benefit other people.
